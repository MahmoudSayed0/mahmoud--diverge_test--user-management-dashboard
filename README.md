## Architecture Questions

### 1. How would you optimize API calls in this application for performance?

To optimize API calls for performance, I would implement a multi-layered approach:

First, I would use request batching and pagination to reduce the number of API calls and limit the data transferred. For the user management dashboard, this means implementing server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering, so we only fetch the exact data needed for the current view. Second, I would implement debouncing for search inputs and throttling for frequent operations to prevent excessive API calls during user interactions. For example, when a user types in the search field, we wait until they pause typing before sending the request.

Additionally, I would leverage a request/response interceptor pattern using Axios to handle common operations like caching responses with appropriate cache headers, implementing retry logic for failed requests, and canceling obsolete requests when new ones are made. Finally, I would optimize the payload size by implementing GraphQL or a custom endpoint that returns only the fields needed for each view, reducing unnecessary data transfer and parsing time.

### 2. Describe your approach to handling shared logic between components.

My approach to handling shared logic between components follows a layered architecture that promotes reusability while maintaining separation of concerns:

At the foundation, I use composable functions (Vue 3 composition API) to extract and share stateful logic between components. For example, I created composables for pagination, filtering, and sorting that can be reused across different list views. These composables encapsulate complex logic while providing a clean interface for components to consume. For UI patterns that appear in multiple places, I develop base components that can be extended or composed to create more specialized components. In this project, I created base components like Button, Input, and Select that are used throughout the application with consistent styling and behavior.

For cross-cutting concerns like authentication, internationalization, and theme management, I use Pinia stores to provide global state that can be accessed by any component. This approach centralizes important application state while making it reactive and easily accessible. Finally, for utility functions and pure logic that doesn't depend on Vue's reactivity, I create dedicated utility modules (like the export utilities) that can be imported wherever needed. This multi-layered approach ensures that shared logic is properly abstracted, tested, and maintained in a single place.

### 3. How would you implement client-side data caching for this dashboard?

For client-side data caching in this dashboard, I would implement a comprehensive strategy that balances performance with data freshness:

I would use a combination of Pinia stores and browser storage mechanisms. Pinia stores would serve as the primary in-memory cache during the application session, storing frequently accessed data like user lists, roles, and statuses. For persistence across sessions, I would implement a custom caching layer using IndexedDB (via a library like Dexie.js) for larger datasets and localStorage for smaller configuration data. This layer would store data with timestamps to track freshness and implement time-based invalidation strategies.

The caching system would follow a stale-while-revalidate pattern, where cached data is immediately displayed to the user while a background request checks for updates. This provides instant feedback while ensuring data eventually becomes consistent. For user-specific operations (create, update, delete), I would implement optimistic UI updates that immediately reflect changes in the UI while the API request is in progress, rolling back only if the request fails. This approach significantly improves perceived performance while maintaining data integrity. The system would also respect cache control headers from the server and provide mechanisms for manual cache invalidation when needed.

### 4. What strategy would you use to scale this application if it needed to support hundreds of different user permission types?

To scale this application for hundreds of different permission types, I would implement a capability-based permission system rather than role-based access control:

Instead of defining permissions at the role level, I would decompose access control into granular capabilities (e.g., "can_view_users", "can_edit_user_email", "can_delete_inactive_users"). These capabilities would be the building blocks of the permission system. Roles would then be defined as collections of these capabilities, allowing for flexible permission combinations without code changes. The UI would dynamically adapt based on the current user's capabilities, showing or hiding elements and enabling or disabling actions accordingly.

On the technical side, I would implement a permission registry that maps capabilities to specific UI elements and actions. This registry would be used by a directive (e.g., `v-can="'edit_user'"`) that can be applied to any element to control its visibility or enabled state. For complex permission scenarios, I would create higher-order components that encapsulate permission logic for specific features. The backend would validate all permissions server-side regardless of UI state to ensure security. This capability-based approach scales efficiently to hundreds of permission types while keeping the codebase maintainable and the UI responsive to permission changes.

### 5. Explain your testing strategy and how you decided what to test.

My testing strategy follows a comprehensive pyramid approach that balances coverage, confidence, and development speed:

At the foundation, I focus on unit tests for pure functions, utilities, and composables that contain complex business logic. For example, the export utilities, filter logic, and pagination calculations would have high unit test coverage to ensure they work correctly in isolation. These tests run quickly and provide immediate feedback during development. For components, I prioritize testing complex interactive components like the UserFilters and UserTable, focusing on user interactions, state changes, and edge cases. I use component testing to verify that components render correctly with different props and respond appropriately to user actions.

For critical user flows like creating a user, editing user details, or exporting data, I implement integration tests that verify multiple components working together. These tests ensure that the components integrate properly and that data flows correctly through the application. Finally, I implement a smaller number of end-to-end tests for the most critical paths in the application, such as the complete user management workflow. These tests run in a real browser environment and verify that the application works as expected from the user's perspective. Throughout the testing process, I prioritize testing based on business impact, complexity, and likelihood of failure, ensuring that the most important aspects of the application are thoroughly tested.

### 6. How would you handle offline capabilities in this application?

To implement offline capabilities in this dashboard, I would create a robust system that allows users to continue working even when disconnected:

First, I would implement a service worker to cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) using Workbox, ensuring the application shell loads even without an internet connection. For data management, I would use IndexedDB to store user data locally, with a synchronization layer that tracks changes made offline and applies them when connectivity is restored. This would include a queue of pending operations (create, update, delete) that are executed in order when the user comes back online.

The UI would clearly indicate the current connection status and which operations are pending synchronization. For example, newly created users might have a "pending" indicator until they're successfully synced to the server. To handle conflicts that might arise during synchronization, I would implement a conflict resolution strategy based on timestamps or version numbers, with options for users to resolve conflicts manually when automatic resolution isn't possible. For security, all offline data would be encrypted using the Web Crypto API, especially for sensitive user information. This comprehensive approach ensures users can continue working productively regardless of network conditions, while maintaining data integrity and security.
